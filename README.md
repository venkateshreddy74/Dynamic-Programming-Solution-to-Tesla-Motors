Dynamic-Programming-Solution-to-Tesla-Motors
============================================

Tesla makes electric cars. But they have a problem in that the car can go only m miles on a charge and specialized charging stations are needed to quickly recharge the battery back to full capacity. To make the cars more appealing to long distance drivers, Tesla is planning to place charging stations along one major highway connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco. They still have the problem of drivers worrying what will happen if their cars run out of charge on the highway in-between two charging stations. Drivers don't want to stop at every charging station either. So Tesla wants you to come with an algorithm that, given the distance from a starting location on the highway to the first charging station, the distance between all intermediate charging stations, and the distance between the last charging station before destination and the destination, will tell the driver which stations to stop at so that he or she makes the minimum number of stops from among the n charging stations between the driver's starting location and destination.
